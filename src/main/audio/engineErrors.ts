/**
 * Structured errors for the audio engine's main-process throw sites.
 *
 * These rejections cross IPC into the renderer, where Electron flattens them to
 * a string and drops every custom property — so the code travels inside the
 * message as a `[TE-ERR:...]` sentinel (see `shared/errors/appError.ts`). The
 * renderer's `setAudioEngineError` choke point translates the code and strips
 * the tail, so the user reads their own language rather than pre-rendered
 * Chinese.
 *
 * The developer prose stays English: it is what lands in logs, stack traces and
 * the diagnostics report, where a fixed language is more useful than a localized
 * one.
 *
 * `code` is the full catalog key suffix (`audio.device_switch_failed`), matching
 * the `error.<code>` entries in the message catalogs. It is spelled out at every
 * call site rather than assembled here, so grepping the catalog key finds the
 * throw.
