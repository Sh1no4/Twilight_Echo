/**
 * Karaoke sources disagree about what a "word" is. Enhanced LRC and YRC both
 * emit one entry per *syllable* and keep whitespace inside the entry text, so a
 * single English word can arrive as `lo` + `ve`. Emphasis and the karaoke mask
 * must operate on the visual word instead, otherwise `love` scales as two
 * independent halves.
 *
 * Two rules matter, and the second is easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. Syllables not separated by whitespace group into one visual word.
 * 2. A CJK character always *terminates* the current group. CJK lines carry no
 *    spaces, so without this every Chinese line would merge into a single unit
 *    and emphasize as one giant word.
