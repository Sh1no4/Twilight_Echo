/**
 * Player bar presentation — shared contract.
 *
 * The playbar has three shapes. `standard` is the full bar (cover, inline
 * progress, time labels). `mini` is a compact control strip: play/pause at the
 * far left, a long flat progress rail in the middle and utility tools on the
 * right. `compact` spans the window edge to edge flush with the bottom, keeping
 * a single row of controls with the progress readout as a hairline along its
 * own top edge.
 *
 * Which controls each shape puts where is a separate contract in
 * `playerBarLayout.ts`; this module only decides which shape applies.
 *
 * Visibility is a separate dimension from shape, with three steps: `visible`
 * keeps the bar on screen, `autoHide` tucks it away until the pointer
 * approaches the bottom edge, and `hidden` removes it entirely with no reveal
 * gesture at all. Both dimensions follow the same global + now-playing-override
 * structure, so the now-playing page can use a different shape, a different
 * visibility, or both. `resolvePlayerBarPresentation` is the single place that
 * decides what applies, so the shell only reads the resolved value.
