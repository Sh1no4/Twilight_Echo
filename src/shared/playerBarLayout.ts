/**
 * Player bar control placement — shared contract.
 *
 * Every shape lays its controls out in the same three regions the stylesheets
 * and the preset theme layouts already know by name: `left`, `center`, `right`.
 * A layout is just which controls sit in which region, in which order, stored
 * per shape so the standard bar, the mini strip and the compact bar can each
 * carry their own arrangement.
 *
 * Two things deliberately stay out of this model:
 *
 * - The progress readout. Each shape renders a different one (standard has the
 *   inline `.progress-area`, mini a long middle rail, compact a hairline along
 *   its top edge), so it is shape chrome rather than a movable control. Making
 *   it placeable would only buy arrangements nothing can render — an inline
 *   progress area in the left region of a 40px strip.
 * - Runtime availability. `exitPlayingPage` only means anything on the
 *   now-playing page, and the favourite button needs a provider that supports
 *   it. Those are conditions the bar checks while rendering, not layout rules.
 *
 * Anything else may go anywhere: rather than maintaining a per-shape allowlist
 * of what is "sensible", each shape's stylesheet sizes whatever it is handed.
