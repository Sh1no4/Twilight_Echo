# ASIO Compatibility Decision Record

Status: personal open-source policy; runtime enabled, hardware evidence remains opt-in

Twilight Echo ships an independent Windows x64 compatibility implementation. The project does not
bundle, include, or compile an ASIO SDK. Installed ASIO drivers are enumerated by default; users can
set `TWILIGHT_DISABLE_ASIO=1` to disable enumeration and activation for troubleshooting or rollback.

For the current personal open-source project, written legal advice and a formal clean-room
sign-off are not release prerequisites. Retain the lightweight provenance record, SDK-free scan
result, ABI manifests, and hardware evidence instead. Do not claim official approval or support,
and do not distribute an ASIO logo.

Obtain a formal legal and license review before a commercial, closed-source, funded, company-run,
hardware-partner, or channel-distributed release. That review must cover the interface,
copyright, patent, license, trademark, and product-facing terminology applicable at that time.

The fallback when this gate is incomplete is WASAPI Shared or WASAPI Exclusive. The project must
not restore an SDK-based build as a temporary workaround.
